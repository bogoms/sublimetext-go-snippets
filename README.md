# Go language snippets for Sublime Text 3
Standard snippets are broken in a way that there are wrong line endings (CR) on Windows machines. Here are all the standard snippets rewritten in a _*.sublime-snippet_ format (as oposed to the original _*.tmSnippet_ format).

# Installation
1. Find the **Go.sublime-package** file (on Windows machine can be found here: *\<installation_path\>\Packages\Go.sublime-package*).
2. Copy it somewhere and rename (the copy) to **Go.zip**
3. Remove all __*.tmSnippet__ files from **Go.zip**.
4. Add all __*.sublime-snippet__ files from this repo to **Go.zip**.
5. Rename the **Go.zip** to **Go.sublime-package** and replace the original file (see item 1).
